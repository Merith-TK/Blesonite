I have been banned from Resonite because of this project which was an effort of love.
The reason for the ban was "You have shown intent to steal assets with your Blender mod" which is a response to me saying
"You could snapshot a session with the Blender client and look around the scene in 3D"
I have cared for this game so much that apparently the team has decided that my lack of toxic positivity is too much.
Play [Overte](https://overte.org/). Resonite is a sinking ship.
